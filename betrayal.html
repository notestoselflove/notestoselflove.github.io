  <h3>Betrayal Beyond Words</h3>
  <p>When they betray you beyond words,</p>

  <p>Will I go low or fly high,</p>

  <p>I could never harm them in the way they did to me,</p>

  <p>Their words biting at my feet,</p>

  <p>Trying to consume me whole,</p>

  <p>Adding insult to injury is an understatement,</p>

  <p>Your stubbornness and recklessness nearly killed us,</p>

  <p>But more importantly me,</p>

  <p>You never cared for your own life,</p>

  <p>And it fucking shows,</p>

  <p>Your death wish is not mine and never has been,</p>

  <p>I will not claim your seat in hell. </p>
